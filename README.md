    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Aaron Jarnagin, I made this website to connect with the cyber community. I am hoping to display some of my skills while learning all aspects of computer programming, coding and, cyber security to achieve a skill set that will eventually land me a job in the computer engineering industry. My true dream is to be a cybersecurity engineer for a company or even the government. I have just started learning about coding creating this website. My goal is to continue creating more of my work from learning on GitHub.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently trying to learn more about different types of development, such as: HTML, CSS, and Python. As well as trying out and using cybersecurity for myself. On my free time, I like to play games, spend time with my family, and educate myself on all aspects of computer development and engineering. Ever since I was just a little child, I have always wanted to find out what computers were really capable of. Every single day, I utilize my computer to become efficient in this environment. The technologies that we have today will get more advanced and will become our future, and I believe more people, including myself, need to learn more about them.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can check out some of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. (There will not be much yet as I am still just learning and do not know about most things about HTML and CSS).
