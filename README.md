    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Aaron Jarnagin and I am currently a person trying to learn about various codes in hopes of being a cybersecurity engineer.
      I have just started learning about coding creating this website. I will contiune to create more of my work from learning on GitHub.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently wanting and trying to learn more about different types of development, like HTML, CSS, and Python. As well as trying out and using cybersecurity for myself
      In my free time, I like to play games and spend time with family. Ever since I was younger, I always wanted to find out what computers were really capable of, so I hope I am able to learn more every single day.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can check out some of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. (There will not be much yet as I am still just learning and do not know about most things about HTML and CSS.
    </p>
